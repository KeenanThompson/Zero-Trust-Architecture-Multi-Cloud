The following Microsoft 365 security capabilities are configured at a lab scale:

## Email and Collaboration Protection

- Safe Attachments policies enabled for inbound mail.

- Anti-phishing policies tuned for stricter detection in user mailboxes.
- Spam and bulk mail filters hardened.

## Authentication and Domain Security

- DMARC policy validated for alignment.

## Monitoring and Visibility
