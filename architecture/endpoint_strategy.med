# Endpoint Strategy

This document describes how endpoints are treated as a first-class security boundary and how different platforms are managed and monitored.

## Goals

- Maintain a consistent security posture across macOS, Windows, Linux, and iOS/iPadOS.
- Use device compliance and EDR telemetry as part of access decisions.
- Ensure endpoints are hardened, monitored, and recoverable.

## Platform Overview

### macOS

- Enrolled into Intune for:
  - Device compliance (encryption, password policy, firewall).
  - Configuration profiles (firewall, FileVault, Gatekeeper, login restrictions where applicable).
- Protected by:
  - Built-in macOS security features.
  - EDR coverage via Defender for Endpoint (onboarding performed where supported) and CrowdStrike.

### iOS/iPadOS

- Enrolled into Intune via Company Portal and Apple MDM integration.
- Configuration and compliance applied for:
  - Passcode requirements.
  - Encryption and device lock.
  - Basic app and device restrictions where defined.
- Used as a second factor and productivity device with controlled access to M365.

### Windows

- Windows endpoint used for:
  - Demonstrating Defender AV and security baselines.
  - Testing identity and browser-based access via Entra ID and Conditional Access.
- Security posture:
  - Defender Antivirus enabled.
  - Firewall enabled.
  - Local configuration used where Intune or Defender for Endpoint integration is constrained by edition.

### Linux

- Ubuntu system hardened with:
  - SSH hardening (key-based auth, restricted configuration).
  - Firewall (ufw) with minimal open ports.
  - auditd, syslog, and related telemetry for process and auth monitoring.
- Can be used for:
  - Host-level logging and correlation in SIEM.
  - Testing IAM-based access to AWS CLI.

## Identity and Access Integration

- Device state is used in Conditional Access:
  - macOS and iOS/iPadOS report compliance via Intune.
  - Windows and Linux are integrated primarily through local controls and identity-side policies.
- CA policies enforce:
  - MFA for all sign-ins.
  - Stronger requirements for admin roles and risky sessions.
  - Location-based rules and risk-based access decisions.

## EDR and Telemetry

- macOS and iOS/iPadOS:
  - CrowdStrike sensors where licensed.
  - Defender for Endpoint on macOS.
- Windows:
  - Defender AV and event logging.
  - EDR integration planned where licensing allows.
- Linux:
  - System logs and auditd used for monitoring.
  - EDR agent planned as an extension.

Endpoints are not treated as trusted by default; they must meet configuration and monitoring requirements before being used for sensitive access.
