# Authentication Strength Configuration

Authentication Strengths implemented in Entra ID:

## Phishing-Resistant Authentication
- FIDO2 security keys
- Passkeys
- Device-bound cryptographic authentication
- Applied to:
  - All admin roles
  - High-risk sign-in scenarios
  - Sensitive applications

## Passwordless + MFA
- Microsoft Authenticator (number matching)
- Passkeys where supported
- Applied to general user sign-ins

## Strong MFA (Fallback)
- Allowed only for break-glass exception flows
- Not used for privileged accounts

## Legacy Authentication
- Fully blocked at the tenant level
- SMTP/POP/IMAP legacy protocols disabled
- No password-only authentication paths remain

Authentication strength is now enforced through CA policies, ensuring consistent Zero Trust identity validation tied to user risk, device risk, and authentication context.
